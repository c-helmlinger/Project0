# Data: The Boston Housing dataset
There are around 500 unique data in this dataset and 13 columns. The 13 columns could be the x variable to predict the y variable (housing price). 
These 13 column including: 
- per capita crime rate by town
- proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- proportion of non-retail business acres per town
- Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- average number of rooms per dwelling
- proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- index of accessibility to radial highways
- full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- pupil-teacher ratio by town
- 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- % lower status of the population
- Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

By doing some organizations, we could find the top factors of housing price and make a model to predict the housing price. 
This model is useful for these people who are not familiar with real estate market but want to know the actual price of a particular house, such as the seller and purchaser.
