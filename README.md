# Project0
In our project, we are going to use housing data from Melbourne, Australia in order to create a prediction of how the housing market will develop in the future. The data we are using was recorded in 2016 and 2017 and relays the price of the house sold, as well as the features that may contribute to any price variances from one house to another including size, bedroom count, and proximity to the inner city. The other variables we are using from this data are the number of total rooms in the house, the housing type, the number of bathrooms, the number of carspots, the land size, the building area, and the year the house was built.  Using these factors as our variables, we are going to train our AI to predict the price of other Melbourne houses by having the AI recognize these variables within the house we input, giving back a price prediction as an output based on its assessment and recognition of the variables that make a house more or less expensive. Though there is inflation between the housing prices listed in the data set we are using to train our AI, which was updated three years ago and uses information from 4-5 years ago, versus the estimated prices of houses today in 2021 with an inflation rate of 13.24%, the price prediction our AI will generate fits the intended purpose and can be later calculated to match inflation rates.
